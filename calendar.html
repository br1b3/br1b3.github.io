                <p>We've all been there... Lost in an unknown planet with no fuel. Tied up by tiny inhabitants and no escape in sight.</p>
                <p>Missions don't always go our way. It is important to stay level headed and remember what we trained to do in hairy situations. Lieutenant Kim will be hosting out semi-annual Field Tactics Training. He will be going over standard Combat skills, Deescalation and Persuasion Techniques, and... when all else fails... Evasion manuvers. This training is manditory and all Space Rangers will need to pass Physical Training in order to return to the field. Rangers who do not pass training will be deployed back to the Star Command Training Base for remediation classes.</p>

                <h5>Office</h5>
                <p>Since everyone had a blast the last time we held one of these events, we invite all Star Command members to the Star Command Research Facility for our annual office clean-out!</p>
                <p>(Pending that we keep the explosions to a minimum...) the Star Command Research Team will be cleaning out their cubicals. The more "interesting" and less useful items the team has come up with in the last orbital cycle will go up on auction for any Star Command member to buy. Please handle all items with caution. Do not forget to sign all release waivers before picking up your auctioned item. All proceeds will be going to the Young Cadets program this year. If you want to learn more or see how you can be a Young Cadets mentor please check our <a href="young-cadets.html">Young Cadets Program Page</a>.</p>

                <h5>Semenar</h5>
                <p>It seems like every corner of the Universe is teeming with new life. In our ever changing landscape, how do you begin to build a long lasting friendship with other life forms our there?</p>
                <p>That is a good question. In fact, it is a question we have been tackling for Milliniums. Here at Star Command it can feel like you meet a new face everytime you step one parsec in any direction. That is why we urge you to not miss the upcoming seminar in diplomatic relations and best practices when making first contact with aliens from other Star Systems. Special guest speakers will include the Little Green Men and Space Ranger Sox. You'll learn everything from what to do when you meet a new life form to field-tested skills on how to pick up new lanuages quickly.</p>

Although the torch has been passed, these gracious guests have been nice enough to come together at Star Comand HQ and answer any and all questions that you may have about the job and even life outside of it.</p>

                <h5>Semenar</h5>
                <p>As you all know, our motto at Star Command is to go to Infinity and Beyond! Over the Orbital Cycles we have already done so much. So what lies beyond the "beyond" for us?</p>
                <p>Lieutenant General Nobfang (Space Orc) will be talking through the future of our Star Systems and Star Command's position within it. Although Star Command has brought a new level of peace to the Galaxy there is still a lot of work to be done. We will be expanding the scope of Star Command's resposibilities which also means that a wide range of new jobs will need to be filled. Nobfang has been supportive of our efforts to learn more about the life that lies beyond our star systems. However, the more we explore, the more we need to remain diligent to protect the life forms we've already commited to. "Our efforts will look as much inward as we do outwards," said Lieutenant General Nobfang. She would like all of Star Command to join her as she explains what going Beyond the Beyond looks like.</p>

                <p>Don't panic. We will go over that scenario and many others in our EMT training. Since there are many things that can go wrong on a mission, it is important that every Ranger is well versed on how to give medical aid in a range of potentially dangerous situations. EVERY Ranger will need to recertify in EMT training before they re-enter the field. Those who fail to certify will be redeployed to the Star Command Training Base for remediation classes.</p>
